<h1>Instructions</h1>   
<p>In this workshop, we will refactor a tic‐tac‐toe game consisting of a series of functions into classes.</p>
<p>These instructions assume you have Python 3 installed. You can use any OS you choose (OS X, Windows,
or Linux).</p>
<h2>Copilot Goals:</h2>
<ul>   
<li>Create classes</li>
<li>Define member variables</li>
<li>Define methods</li>
<li>Experiment with inheritance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1 –Convert function based tic-tac-toe to classes</h2>
<p>Open the game.py file the before folder.  This code is the working game written using functions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quick review of defining classes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Before you get started, here is a quick review of defining classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes are defined using the class keyword.</li>
<li>Methods are defined just as functions, but they usually take a self parameter.</li>
<li>Properties are defined just like methods, but with @property decorators.</li>
<li>Instances of the classes are created by simply calling them.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Convert tic-tac-toe to classes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now your task will be to define 3 classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program</li>
<li>Game</li>
<li>Board</li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality of the game should be spread across three classes. Here is one such partitioning.</p>

<p>In addition to this basic structure, each of these classes will need a few fields (e.g. board should have a
cells field).</p>
<p>Using this guidance, covert the function‐based game to a class‐based game. It should run identically.</p>
