The `app.js` file is the main entry point of the Express application. It sets up the server, defines routes, and handles HTTP requests and responses.

Here are the key components and functionalities of `app.js`:

- **Express Setup**: The file starts by requiring the Express module and creating an instance of the Express application.

- **Middleware**: Various middleware functions are used to enhance the functionality of the application. These can include body parsing, logging, error handling, and more.

- **Routes**: The file defines routes for different HTTP methods and URLs. Each route can have one or more handler functions that are executed when the route is matched.

- **Static Files**: If the application serves static files (e.g., CSS, images), the `express.static` middleware is used to serve them from a specified directory.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling middleware is used to catch and handle any errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

- **Server Setup**: The file sets up the server by listening on a specified port and logging a message when the server starts successfully.

This is just a brief summary of the `app.js` file. For more details, please refer to the actual code.
